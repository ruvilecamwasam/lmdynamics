Here I have uploaded all the code from the article "Dynamics and Stability of an Optically Levitated Mirror". 

I wrote this code as I went, without thinking of it being used by other people. Because of this it is a bit opaque in many areas. If you would like to use any of the code, or have any questions about how to use it, feel free to send me an email.
